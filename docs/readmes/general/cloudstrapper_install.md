# Deploying Magma via Cloudstrapper

In the past it was possible to set up Magma within Amazon Web Services using [the Cloudstrapper product in AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-wkchyk2okdnhc?qid=1627070115980&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_title). This option is no longer supported because the level of demand may be too low to justify the development work.

Deployers who would find this feature useful can help by commenting on [the relevant ticket](https://github.com/magma/magma/issues/13995). In the spirit of open source, you are welcome to submit a proposal to implement it yourself.

You may find [the documentation for this feature as it was](https://github.com/magma/magma/blob/01466f53c31b1d20c21309aafae7b3f3df1f78df/docs/readmes/general/cloudstrapper_install.md) valuable.
